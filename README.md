# ps5debug-NG

A debugger payload for jailbroken PlayStation 5 consoles. Ships a userland
command server that runs inside SceShellCore, letting remote clients inspect
and manipulate running processes, the kernel itself, and the system UI over a
simple TCP protocol.

ps5debug-NG is inspired by Ctn's `ps5debug 1.0b5` and is wire-compatible with
it - existing clients should work without modification. It is licensed under
GPL-3.

## Supported firmwares

The kernel kpatch routine in [installer/source/main.c](installer/source/main.c)
recognises the following firmware families. Booting on an unsupported FW prints
`port_outer: kpatch SKIP - unsupported FW magic 0x...` to the kernel log and
aborts cleanly.

| Family | Point releases recognised                       | Status                                    |

| 7.xx   | 7.00, 7.01, 7.01.01, 7.20, 7.40, 7.60, 7.61     | Initial support added - testing required  |
| 8.xx   | 8.00, 8.20, 8.40, 8.60                          | Fully Verified                            |
| 9.xx   | 9.00, 9.05, 9.20, 9.40, 9.60                    | Fully Verified                            |
| 10.xx  | 10.00, 10.01, 10.20, 10.40, 10.60               | Fully Verified                            |

The point releases above are the exact FW magic values recognised by the switch
in [installer/source/main.c](installer/source/main.c); that file is the source
of truth. Clients can read the running FW with `CMD_FW_VERSION`, which returns
the firmware as a decimal `uint16_t` (e.g. `900` for 9.00, `1240` for 12.40).

## Primary Features

### Process inspection and manipulation
- **Enumerate processes** (process name + pid list).
- **Read and write target memory** in streamed chunks.
- **List virtual memory maps** - ranges, protections, backing names.
- **Query process metadata** - name, path, titleId, contentId.
- **Identify the foreground app** (`0xBDDD0006`) - returns pid + titleid +
  contentid + process name + the game's version, parsed server-side from the
  title's `param.sfo`. Useful for clients that need to know what's currently
  running without listing every process.
- **Server-side stack walk** (`CMD_PROC_READ_STACK`) - the server walks the
  RBP chain itself (up to 64 frames) and bundles each frame's saved-RBP,
  return address, frame-local bytes, and a 200-byte code window around the
  return address into one response. Clients avoid paying many TCP round-trips
  per stack frame.
- **Change memory protection** on arbitrary target regions.
- **Allocate / free / hint-allocate** memory inside any target process.

### In-target code execution
- **Call arbitrary functions** with up to six SysV ABI register arguments and
  read back `rax` (`CMD_PROC_CALL`) - serviced kernel-side via `sys_proc_cmd`.
- **Install an RPC stub** (`CMD_PROC_INTALL`, opcode `0xBDAA0005`; note the
  source spelling). In the current build this handler is a stub that returns a
  `0` handle and performs no injection.
- **Load ELFs** into a target process - either jump to the entry point
  immediately (`CMD_PROC_ELF`) or return the entry for later invocation
  (`CMD_PROC_ELF_RPC`).

### Full userland debugger
- **Attach** to a single target with `CMD_DEBUG_ATTACH` (sets up an async
  interrupt channel back to the client).
- **Software breakpoints** - up to **30** slots, transparent `0xCC` injection.
- **Hardware watchpoints** - up to **4** DR0-DR3 slots with read / write /
  read-write and 1/2/4/8-byte granularity.
- **Thread control** - list, suspend, resume, single-step, per-thread step.
- **Full register access** - general-purpose, FPU + YMM, and debug registers.
- **Continue / stop / halt** the whole process from one command.
- **Asynchronous interrupt packets** delivered on a separate TCP connection so
  the client never polls.

### Kernel access
- Get the **kernel base address**.
- **Read** arbitrary kernel memory.
- **Write** arbitrary kernel memory.

### Built-in Zydis disassembler
Large memory regions never leave the PS5. Three server-side decoder commands
keep bandwidth low:
- `CMD_PROC_DISASM_REGION` - packed 32-byte-per-instruction stream with
  control-flow, memory-operand, and RIP-relative metadata.
- `CMD_PROC_EXTRACT_CODE_XREFS` - all resolved RIP-relative operand targets in
  a region, streamed (not deduplicated server-side).
- `CMD_PROC_FIND_XREFS_TO` - only instructions whose RIP-relative target equals
  a specific address.

### Built-in Keystone assembler (x86-64)
A cross-compiled LLVM-MC Keystone (x86-only, no exceptions / no RTTI, static
~4 MB) is embedded in the payload, exposed via the raw-literal opcode
`0xBDAA0024`. Lets clients assemble asm text into machine code on the console
itself.
- Pure userspace - needs no attached process and no `CMD_PROC_AUTH` handshake.
- Request: `u64 base_addr; u32 ks_opt_syntax;` + asm text (NUL not required).
  `ks_opt_syntax` defaults to Intel; pass 1/2/4/8/0x10 for Intel/ATT/NASM/MASM/GAS.
- Response: `CMD_SUCCESS` + `u32 byte_len; u32 insn_count;` + machine bytes,
  or `CMD_ERROR` + `u32 ks_errno; u32 msg_len;` + Keystone's human-readable error.
- The opcode is deliberately a raw literal (no `CMD_*` macro) so the published
  `CMD_*` set that some clients enumerate stays unchanged.

### Memory scanning
- **Value scan** (`CMD_PROC_SCAN`) - single-pass, 12 value types × 13 compare
  modes (exact, fuzzy, bigger/smaller, between, increased, decreased, changed,
  etc.).
- **Iterative scan** (`SCAN_START` → `SCAN_COUNT` → `SCAN_GET`) - narrows a
  result set over many passes. The client holds the candidate list and streams
  it back each pass; the server re-reads memory and re-compares.
- **AOB scan** (`CMD_PROC_SCAN_AOB`) - byte patterns with a per-byte wildcard
  mask.
- **Multi-pattern AOB scan** (`CMD_PROC_SCAN_AOB_MULTI`) - many patterns in
  one pass.
- **Auth-gated** - only the iterative scan trio (`SCAN_START` / `SCAN_COUNT` /
  `SCAN_GET`) requires a prior `CMD_PROC_AUTH` handshake; the value scan and the
  AOB scans do not.

### System UI integration
- **Push notifications** to the user's screen with arbitrary UTF-8 text.
- **Print** to the kernel console.
- **Reboot** the console.

### Klog forwarder
- TCP **3232** streams the kernel log to a connected client (host-side
  `klog reader` style). Survives suspend/resume the same as the main server.

### Discovery
- A UDP broadcast responder on port `1010` echoes a handshake magic
  (`0xFFFFAAAA`) so clients can find the PS5 on the LAN without hard-coding
  an IP.

### Rest-mode support
- The payload **survives suspend / resume** without needing to be reloaded.
  A supervisory loop polls the network periodically: when the console drops
  into rest mode the server exits cleanly, and as soon as the network comes
  back the server restarts and a fresh "online" notification fires.
- Clients see a clean disconnect on port 744 when rest mode begins and can
  simply reconnect after wake.

### Performance-oriented design
- Non-blocking sockets with `TCP_NODELAY`, `SO_KEEPALIVE`, large transfer
  chunks.
- Zydis amalgamation compiled at `-O3 -DNDEBUG` for maximum decode throughput.
- Link-time dead stripping (`-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections
  -Wl,--gc-sections`).
- Interrupt packets streamed over a dedicated side channel to avoid blocking
  the command loop.

## Architecture

The deployable artifact `ps5debug-NG.elf` is a two-component build:

```

```

- **installer** - umtx-loaded SDK PIE. Finds SceShellCore, sets up the
  target's KEX state and syscall-origin filter, then calls the SCE-side
  `inject_remote_thread_create` primitive to run the embedded debugger as
  a SceShellCore-internal thread.
- **debugger** - runs inside SceShellCore once injected. Implements the
  wire protocol, breakpoints / watchpoints / single-step, memory scan, RPC,
  and ELF inject. Built into `debugger/build/debugger.elf`, then embedded as
  a `.rodata` blob into the installer via `.incbin`.

Running the wire protocol from inside SceShellCore is what lets `PT_ATTACH`
on game pids look kernel-side like an SCE-originated debug attach, which
PS5's AppContext gating allows. A standalone process doing `PT_ATTACH` gets
the game flagged and stops progressing.

## Network protocol at a glance

| Port  | Proto | Direction      | Purpose                              |
|-------|-------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 744   | TCP   | client → PS5   | Command server                       |
| 755   | TCP   | PS5 → client   | Async debug interrupts               |
| 3232  | TCP   | PS5 → client   | Kernel log forwarder                 |
| 1010  | UDP   | bidirectional  | Discovery beacon (`0xFFFFAAAA`)      |

Every command begins with a 12-byte header:

```c
struct cmd_packet {
    uint32_t magic;      // 0xFFAABBCC
    uint32_t cmd;        // 0xBDAA..., 0xBDBB..., 0xBDCC..., 0xBDDD...
    uint32_t datalen;    // length of request body that follows
};
```

Followed by the command's fixed request struct (if any) and any trailing
variable-length payload. The reply shape is per-command: most replies begin
with a `uint32_t` status word (some commands send two, and the info/version
commands send their data with no status word at all) - see
[PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for the exact sequence of each.

**Note on status words.** The status `uint32_t` on PS5 is transmitted with
its bit pairs swapped (`net_send_int32` swaps even/odd-bit positions). Clients
must account for the swap - either un-bitswap the incoming word and compare to
the server-side constants (`CMD_SUCCESS = 0x40000000`, etc., as the example
below does), or compare the raw word against the pre-swapped values
(`CMD_SUCCESS = 0x80000000`, etc.). Subsequent payload bytes are sent raw.

**Full protocol specification:** [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) - every command,
every packet struct, every enum, every status code, with `file:line`
citations.

## Command coverage

| Namespace     | Count | Examples                                                   |
|---------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Info / ping   | 5     | `VERSION`, `FW_VERSION`, `BRANDING`, `PLATFORM_ID`, `NOP`  |

## Building

Prerequisites (Ubuntu / Debian):

```sh
sudo apt install bash clang-18 lld-18
```

Build:

```sh
./build.sh
```

This builds the SDK first (one-time, cached), then the debugger, then the
installer (which embeds the debugger), then publishes `ps5debug-NG.elf` at
the top level. Subsequent runs only rebuild what changed.

Clean (including the SDK install):

```sh
./build.sh clean
```

---

## Deploying

`ps5debug-NG.elf` is loaded onto the PS5 via a umtx-based ELF loader (e.g.
elfldr from etaHEN-class loaders).

You should see a system notification confirming the payload is alive:

```
ps5debug-NG by OSR v1.2.6 loaded!
Firmware: 9.00
Coded by OpenSourcereR
Special thanks to
golden, Ctn,  SiSTRo, EchoStretch, 
Sonic-Iso & Pharaoh2k!  ❤
```

(`Firmware:` shows the running console's firmware, e.g. `9.00` or `12.40`.)

---

## Writing your own client

The protocol is deliberately simple - a raw TCP client in any language can
drive it. Example: pinging the server and reading its branding string, in
Python (don't forget the bit-pair swap on the status word):

```python
import socket, struct

PACKET_MAGIC = 0xFFAABBCC
CMD_BRANDING = 0xBD000501
CMD_SUCCESS  = 0x40000000

def bitswap32(x):
    x &= 0xFFFFFFFF
    return ((x << 1) & 0xAAAAAAAA) | ((x >> 1) & 0x55555555)

s = socket.create_connection(("<PS5_IP>", 744))
s.sendall(struct.pack("<III", PACKET_MAGIC, CMD_BRANDING, 0))
(status_raw,) = struct.unpack("<I", s.recv(4))
assert bitswap32(status_raw) == CMD_SUCCESS
(length,) = struct.unpack("<I", s.recv(4))
print("server branding:", s.recv(length).decode())
```

See [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for the exact byte layout of every command,
response, and async interrupt packet.

Three source files (`kern_rw_fast.c`, `proc_elf.c`, `proc_remote.c`) and
`main.c` exist in **both** `debugger/source/` and `installer/source/` because
they genuinely diverge between the two builds - same code specialized for
each component's role.
